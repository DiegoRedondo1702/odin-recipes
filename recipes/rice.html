<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A rice cooker can be a very handy kitchen gadget, especially if you like to make (or eat) a lot of rice. It works by bringing the liquid in the rice recipe to a boil very quickly. Because the rice cooker environment is sealed, it reduces the air pressure over the liquid so it boils faster. A temperature sensor within the machine monitors the heat inside the cooker; when it starts to rise above 212 F (the boiling point of water), that means that the rice has absorbed all the liquid. The cooker will automatically switch to a warm setting. The whole process typically takes about 20 minutes or less.

  It's important to read the instructions that come with your rice cooker and follow them to the letter. These instructions were developed by the company for your specific rice cooker. Doing so will ensure you get good results every time.
  
  Not all rice is the same; different textures will produce different outcomes when they are prepared in the rice cooker. For example, short-grain rice such as Arborio rice (used for risotto) and sticky rice (in Asian cuisines) has a lot of starch (also called amylopectin). This starch is highly branched and tends to stick together so that rice will always be stickier and less fluffy than other varieties.
  
  Long-grain rice should be fluffy and not stick together because it has more amylose, a starch molecule that is long and straight. The molecule doesn't get tangled up with other molecules when the rice cooks. Medium-grain rice should be fluffy but with a slightly stickier texture since it has roughly equal amounts of amylose and amylopectin. 
  
  Based on the finished texture you prefer, choose the right rice for your eating preferences. When following the rice cooker instructions, make sure to prepare the rice as dictated by your specific variety. You will also need to measure the rice accurately; most rice cookers will come with their own measuring cups.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 to 2 cups rice (depending on the type)</li>
  <li>2 cups water</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions that come with your rice cooker for the type of rice you are preparing. For most rice cookers, combine 1 cup of rice with 1 1/2 to 2 cups of liquid; this will yield about 3 cups of cooked rice or enough for 6 (1/2-cup) servings.</li>
  <li>Turn the rice cooker on and let it cook according to the instructions.</li>
  <li>Most rice cookers can keep the cooked rice warm for hours without burning. Check to see if your rice cooker has a specific warming setting or if it will activate automatically. Enjoy with your favorite recipes, or on its own.</li>
